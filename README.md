# mm-project-2020
Examples and stubs to form the basis of the ZPEM2311 Mathematical Modelling Major Project for 2020.

## example.ipynb
The [`example.ipynb` notebook](https://github.com/BenKaehler/mm-project-2020/blob/master/notebooks/example.ipynb) provides a **starting point** for what your analysis and results notebook should be. It also shows how your `model.py` module should work, and how to download data from the [Open COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/open-covid-19/data).

## model_stubs.py
The [`model_stubs.py` Python file](https://github.com/BenKaehler/mm-project-2020/blob/master/notebooks/model_stubs.py) provides function stubs that show the interface to your model and give clues about how it should work. You should start by renaming it `model.py`.

## How to begin
Note that both files are in the [notebooks](https://github.com/BenKaehler/mm-project-2020/blob/master/notebooks) directory of this repository. You should start by forking this repository into one of your group members' accounts. Each group member should then take a local clone of the fork.
